Project Description:  
  
Your organization wishes to understand how to change outcomes for Medicare patients. To maximize impact, your group will have to determine:

    2) What states are models of high-quality care?  
    3) Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?  
    4) Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

W205 - Exercise 1

Project Description:

Your organization wishes to understand how to change outcomes for Medicare patients. To maximize impact, your group will have to determine:
  1) What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of         procedures?
	2) What states are models of high-quality care?
	3) Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?
	4) Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

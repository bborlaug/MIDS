  The list above accounts for each hospital's general quality, ability to prevent death, and patient survey 
  responses.  For this iteration of the study, each of these characteristics are weighted evenly.  Future work should 
  go into properly weighting each of these categories (by confidence, importance, etc.).  Future work should also go 
  into including hospitals in the rankings who did not have data for one or more sections of the study (~60% of hospitals
  are considered here).

The final question asked whether hospital quality was coorelated with the HCAHPS survey responses.  The measure that
was used for hospital quality (quality score - QS) was derived in-part from survey responses so it would be obvious
that the two are coorelated.  To answer this question, I must instead use a different measure of quality.  I decided to use the Quality Care
(QC) score to represent hospital quality since I am certain it was scored independent of survey responses (HCAHPS_base).  In R,
I plotted the survey scores against QC for each hospital to see if there was a linear relationship.  Here are the results:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
For every increase of one point on the HCAHPS base survey (scored from 0-to-80), the hospitals QC score saw a decrease of 0.02
(scored from 0-to-33.33).  While the p-value is significant, the effect size is so small that there appears to be no
practically significant correlation between hospital quality and HCAHPS scores.  This is, of course, assuming that the
method I employed for determining quality (the QC value) is sound.  This result suggests that I may have alotted too much
weight to patient surveys in my hospital quality score (QS) calculations.  It looks like there is actually close to no correlation
between survey scores and quality.

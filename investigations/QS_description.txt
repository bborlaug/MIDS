HOW HOSPITAL QUALITY SCORES WERE DETERMINED
-------------------------------------------

It was decided that a high-quality hospital should do the following:  

1) Provide quality care (QC)
	i) Timeliness (QCT)
	ii) Correct protocol (QCCP)
	iii) Accurate diagnoses (QCAD)
2) Save lives/prevent deaths (PD)
3) Treat it's patients well (PW)

A high-quality hospital must score well in each of it's three primary responsibilities (QC, PD, PW).  As an initial assessment,
each category is weighted evenly to calculate an overall Quality Score (QS) on a scale of 0-to-100.  Hospitals can be sorted by
their QS to provide an indication of their quality in relation to other hospitals contained in the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services' publicly-available "Hospital Compare" dataset.  The data was collected over various time periods ranging from
2011 to 2014.

Only select measures were used to calculate the categorical scores (QCT, QCCP, QCAD, PD, PW) used to generate a hospital's QS.
The measures used for this analysis can be found in the "chosen_measures.csv" file.  The PW categorical score was calculated from each hospitals base score on the HCAHPS Patient Survey.  The survey measures patient perspectives on care and patient rating items that encompass the following key topics: communication with hospital staff, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of hospital environment, quietness of hospital environment, and transition of care.
